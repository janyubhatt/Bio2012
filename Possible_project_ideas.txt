Codex for proteins-where we can put a protein sequence and find stats about it
-Molecular weight
-number of residues
-number of hydrophobic/hydrophillic residues
-pair with DNA sequence/or find the organisms that have this protein
-different domains
-substrates

A PCR app. One that could tell you where primers would bind in a genome. 
It would be nice to have one that could tell you the appropriate 
annealing temp based in gc content and see if there unique restriction sites 
in the primers.
They already exist but it would be cool to design your own.
